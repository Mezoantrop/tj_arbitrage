//In this updated version, the require statements are used to check if the token approvals and swap operations are successful. 
//If any of these conditions fail, the function will revert and throw an error message.
//Additionally, the amounts array returned by the swap function is used to validate the amounts of tokens used and received. 
//These validations ensure that the expected amounts are met, preventing unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
//Regarding gas optimization, the code uses the approve function only once for each token before performing the swaps. 
//This reduces gas costs compared to approving the spender for each swap operation.
//Remember to replace <TRADER_JOE_ADDRESS>, <TOKEN_A_ADDRESS>, and <TOKEN_B_ADDRESS> with the actual addresses of the Trader Joe DEX, Token A, and Token B, respectively. Also, perform comprehensive testing and auditing before deploying this code to a production environment.
